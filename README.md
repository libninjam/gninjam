# gninjam
clone of the original gninjam codebase

this is the pristine state of the initial fork/conversion from sourceforge svn - it includes the full svn history of both the master and experimental branches - the two branches are significantly divergent and are mutually incompatible - this is the master branch with the canonical feature set

to be clear - all of the commit history to this point was initially the svn history which was automagically converted to git format via web-based import into github
the original clone address used was ```http://svn.code.sf.net/p/gninjam/code```
